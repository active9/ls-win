#ls-win

ls for windows

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install ls-win -g
```

  Run the command line:

```bash
$ ls
```

## Philosophy

  If you are like many 133t speaking nerd programmers out there you find yourself typing in ls
  while using a windows command prompt. ls-win simply executes the command dir everytime you type
  in ls if installed as a global npm package. This is designed to work with windows based systems.
  ls-win took roughly 15 minutes to create and is designed to increase productivity for cross-platform
  users.

## How It Works

  It simply executes dir for you automagically.

## TODO
  - argv directory switch passing
